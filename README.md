# OpenCV Learning Repository

This repository contains my OpenCV learning journey based on tutorials from the [sentdex YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex). The focus of these tutorials was to develop a strong understanding of image and video processing using OpenCV in Python.

## Topics Covered

1. **Capturing Photos & Videos**  
   - Techniques for reading from webcams and saving media.
   
2. **Image Operations**  
   - Basic image manipulations: loading, displaying, and saving images.
   
3. **Arithmetic & Logic Operations**  
   - Merging images, bitwise operations, and blending techniques.
   
4. **Thresholding**  
   - Binarizing images using global and adaptive thresholding methods.
   
5. **Color Filtering**  
   - Isolating colors within images and videos using HSV color space.
   
6. **Blurring & Smoothing**  
   - Applying Gaussian, Median, and Bilateral filters to reduce noise.
   
7. **Morphological Transformations**  
   - Operations like erosion, dilation, opening, and closing to process binary images.
   
8. **Edge Detection**  
   - Detecting edges using the Canny and Sobel methods.
   
9. **Template Matching**  
   - Finding objects in images by matching templates.
   
10. **Foreground Extraction**  
    - Extracting the foreground from the background using GrabCut and other techniques.
    
11. **Corner Detection**  
    - Detecting corners in images using Harris corner detection and Shi-Tomasi method.
    
12. **Feature Matching**  
    - Matching keypoints between images using SIFT, SURF, and ORB.
    
13. **Background Reduction**  
    - Techniques to reduce background noise and improve foreground focus.
    
14. **Haar Cascade**  
    - Using pre-trained Haar cascades for object detection, including face and eye detection.
